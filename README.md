# CondInst-Filament-Detection

We proposed a new solar filaments detection and classification method based on CondInst. The results show that the method performs well in detecting and classifying isolated and non-isolated filaments,especially in solving the fragments problem.

## detectron2

Some codes in detectron2 has been changed by us.

The modifications include adding the categories of solar filaments, supporting Adam optimazer and so on.

**The Code will be released soon.**
